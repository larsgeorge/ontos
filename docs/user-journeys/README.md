- Detailed step-by-step workflows with timelines
- Sequence diagrams for both minimal and elaborate teams
- Key questions answered about team structure and processes

**Key Insights:**
- Minimal team: 2-3 people, 1-3 weeks timeline
- Elaborate team: 5-8 people, 1-3 months timeline
- Contracts First approach is strongly recommended
- Handover managed via status transitions in Ontos

---

### [02. Lifecycle States](02-lifecycle-states.md)
**Complete lifecycle definitions and state machines**

- Data Contract statuses and transitions
- Data Product statuses and transitions
- Privacy and visibility rules by lifecycle stage
- State transition rules and triggers
- Approval gates and criteria

**Status Values:**

**Data Contracts:**
- DRAFT ‚Üí PROPOSED ‚Üí UNDER_REVIEW ‚Üí APPROVED ‚Üí ACTIVE ‚Üí DEPRECATED ‚Üí REJECTED

**Data Products:**
- DEVELOPMENT ‚Üí SANDBOX ‚Üí PENDING_CERTIFICATION ‚Üí CERTIFIED ‚Üí ACTIVE ‚Üí DEPRECATED ‚Üí ARCHIVED

---

### [03. Implementation Roadmap](03-implementation-roadmap.md)
**3-phase implementation plan**

- **Phase 1 (MVP):** 4-6 weeks - Lifecycle states, versioning, basic reviews, subscriptions
- **Phase 2 (Enterprise):** 6-8 weeks - Workflows, certification, compliance automation, marketplace
- **Phase 3 (Advanced):** 8-12 weeks - Live monitoring, AI suggestions, lineage viz, trust scores

**Top Priorities:**
1. Explicit lifecycle states (blocking all workflows)
2. Contract versioning (needed for iterations)
3. Steward review UI (core governance)
4. Product-contract linking (ensures adherence)
5. Consumer subscriptions (enables tracking)

---

### [04. Persona Responsibilities](04-persona-responsibilities.md)
**Role definitions and responsibility matrices**

- Complete persona catalog (core, extended, supporting)
- RACI matrices by lifecycle stage
- Decision authority matrix
- Team size recommendations
- Communication patterns and handover protocols

**Core Personas:**
- Data Product Owner (vision, value, stakeholders)
- Data Engineer (implementation, operations)
- Data Steward (governance, compliance, quality)
- Data Consumer (consumption, feedback)

---

### [05. Gap Analysis](05-gap-analysis.md)
**Current state assessment and gaps**

- Detailed gap analysis by feature area
- Feature coverage by implementation phase
- Risk assessment (technical and adoption)
- Migration strategy and rollback plans
- Success metrics for each phase
- Comparison with industry standards

**Current Readiness:**
- Minimal workflow: 60% ready (4-6 weeks to MVP)
- Elaborate workflow: 40% ready (10-14 weeks to full support)

## üîë Key Takeaways

### 1. Team Composition
- **Minimal (2-3 people):** Product Owner + Data Engineer + (optional) Analyst
- **Elaborate (5-8 people):** + Lead Engineer, Business Analyst, QA Engineer, Steward liaison
- Roles are fluid in minimal teams, specialized in elaborate teams

### 2. Workflow Approach
- **Contracts First** is the recommended approach
- Contracts serve as formal interface and commitment to consumers
- Forces teams to think about consumer needs, quality, and semantics upfront
- Products are built against approved contracts

### 3. Lifecycle Management
- Objects start **private** to team (DRAFT, DEVELOPMENT)
- Become **visible to stewards** during review (PROPOSED, PENDING_CERTIFICATION)
- Become **organization-wide** after certification (CERTIFIED)
- Become **public in catalog** when active (ACTIVE)

### 4. Steward Involvement
- **Two key gates:** Contract Approval & Product Certification
- Review contracts for: compliance, clarity, ownership, SLOs, security, interoperability
- Certify products for: contract adherence, quality, lineage, documentation, security, operations

### 5. Implementation Priority
1. **Phase 1 (MVP):** Enable minimal teams with basic lifecycle and reviews
2. **Phase 2 (Enterprise):** Support elaborate teams with formal workflows
3. **Phase 3 (Advanced):** Differentiate with AI and live monitoring
