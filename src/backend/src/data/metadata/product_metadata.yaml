          # Marketing Domain

          The Marketing domain focuses on customer engagement, personalization, and campaign
          effectiveness. Typical assets include customer profiles, segmentation models,
          propensity and uplift scores, and activation datasets for outbound channels.

          Core concepts often used across data products:
          - Customer identity and householding
          - Consent and channel preferences
          - Campaign taxonomy and lifecycle
          - Response and attribution measures

          Governance highlights include consent management and PII handling standards.
